GYM-Website:

A Gym Website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript showcases gym services, facilities, and schedules. Using HTML, you structure key sections like the homepage, class details, trainer profiles, and contact forms. With CSS, you create an attractive design, ensuring a professional and engaging user interface. JavaScript adds interactivity, such as dynamic class schedules, testimonials sliders, or a membership form with validation. The website can also be made responsive for seamless browsing on all devices.
